# NewHope

This is a fork of [NewHope by Alkim, Ducas, PÃ¶ppelmann and Schwabe](https://github.com/tpoeppelmann/newhope) with some optimizations to the coefficients sampling method. Details on NewHope are available [here](https://cryptojedi.org/crypto/#newhope) and in the [original paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1092).

The goal is to demonstrate possible performance improvements by leveraging modern processor architecture features.
